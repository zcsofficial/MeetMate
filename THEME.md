Color Palette

    Primary (Main Brand Color): #0066FF (Bright Blue)
        A vibrant, confident blue that conveys trust, professionalism, and technology—perfect for a networking app.
        Used in your buttons, links, and active states.
    Secondary (Supporting Color): #4F46E5 (Deep Indigo)
        A richer, slightly purple-toned blue for contrast and hierarchy (e.g., hover states or secondary buttons).
        Adds sophistication without straying too far from the primary.
    Neutral Base: #F9FAFB (Light Gray)
        A soft, almost-white gray for backgrounds (replacing bg-gray-50 in <body>).
        Keeps the interface clean and airy, enhancing readability.
    Neutral Text: #1F2A44 (Dark Slate)
        A deep, legible gray-blue for text (replacing generic text-gray-900).
        Professional yet softer than pure black.
    Accent Success: #10B981 (Emerald Green)
        A fresh green for positive actions or stats (e.g., match percentages, growth indicators like +24%).
        Already in your UI as text-green-500.
    Accent Warning: #F59E0B (Amber)
        A warm yellow-orange for alerts or highlights (e.g., urgent notifications).
        Adds subtle energy without clashing.
    Neutral Borders: #E2E8F0 (Slate Gray)
        A light gray for borders and dividers (replacing border-gray-300).
        Keeps elements defined without feeling heavy.
